There are a few bugs that I couldn't resolve without taking more time than was provided:
- When a user enters the application (after login in) only the bottom navigation bar should appear, but if you tap the desired tab the screen content should be ok.
- Not all classes have unit tests, just the repository ones due testing with Firebase is a little tricky.
- Password fields do not have the visualization toggle.
- Detail screen not implemented.
